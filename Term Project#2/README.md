* A report that describes the same and the different parts in the “best” data for the modeling algorithms.

* A report that describes the topology or the hyperparameters of your models, e.g., # convolution layers, kernel size, pooling strategy, etc. for CNN; type of kernel, cost and gamma used in SVM, and any other important specification of your models.

* Convert the prediction output from each model for the first test example into human-comprehensible if-then-else classification rules. If you think it is practically impossible, just say so in your report.
